Sometimes life feels like a random browser tab—you never know 
which page the next click will open. A day that starts with morning tea often ends with evening tiredness,
filled in between with small wins and mistakes. Notifications on a phone distract the mind, while silence often says the most.
Not every day is perfect, but every day teaches something.
